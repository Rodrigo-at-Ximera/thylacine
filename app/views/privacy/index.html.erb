            how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US

          <h5>Do we use 'cookies'?</h5>
          <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your
            computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service
            provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.</p>
          <p>We use cookies to understand and save user's
            preferences for future visits.</p>

          <h5>Third-party disclosure</h5>
          <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally
            Identifiable Information.</p>

          <h5>Third-party links</h5>
          <p>We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website.</p>

          <h5>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h5>
          <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age
            of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal
            Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out
            what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety
            online.</p>
          <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

          <h5>Fair Information Practices</h5>
          <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the
            United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data
            protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they
            should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal
            information.</p>
          <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
              action: Should a data breach occur we will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days.</p>
          <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals
            have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to
            adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
            users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or
            prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
